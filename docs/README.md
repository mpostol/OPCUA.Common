# OPCUA.Common Repository

## Executive summary

The `OPCUA.Common` repository was derived from `CAS.UA.Common` rel 3.00.05. The `CAS.UA.Common` software was written by CAS Lodz Poland. I am the founder and Executive Director of CAS. Now CAS is just an individual business activity conducted by me, so I decided to move this software to Open Source. By design, it is also a consistent part of the broader concept [Object-Oriented Internet](https://commsvr.gitbook.io/ooi/).

Intentionally this repository should provide NuGet definitions for all main components defined in the OPC UA specification and used elsewhere outside the OPC UA application (client/server), namely:

- common definitions
- data serialization
- address space management
- configuration
- TBD

This project is aimed at software development and maintenance published as the Open-Source Software (OSS). OSS is a type of computer software in which source code is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose. The `CommServer UA` software was written by CAS Lodz Poland. I am the founder and Executive Director of CAS. Now CAS is just an individual business activity conducted by me, so I decided to move this software to Open Source.

## Partnership program

I am a researcher and University associate who is passionate about applying knowledge and experience in building a Machine to Machine (M2M) meaningful interoperability based on OPC UA. Let's build it with you and for you. To join our effort and create an organizational context I have launched an open-access **Object-Oriented Internet Partnership Program**. Hence, maintenance of this repository and further development of the OPC UA Information Model Domain-Specific Language will be carried out under a broader concept described in the following article
